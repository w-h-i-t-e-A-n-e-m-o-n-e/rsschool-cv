## About Me
I've never worked in the IT-industry, but I've always enjoyed working with computers. After school I decided to study programming at university, but things didn't go as planned and I changed my course of study to linguistics. However, a year ago, I realized that I had the skills to become a developer, so now I'm learning programming again. My goal is to master front-end (or maybe even a full stack, because I have an interest in python too) development and pursue a career in this field in the future.

## Projects
I used to have a portfolio with projects, but then I realized that many of them weren't so good, and I decided to create a new, better portfolio with better projects. So just wait for the update!

For now all I have is [this CV](https://github.com/w-h-i-t-e-A-n-e-m-o-n-e/rsschool-cv) and [number base converter](https://github.com/w-h-i-t-e-A-n-e-m-o-n-e/number_base_converter).

            console.log(i)
            return i;
        } else if ((((i-1)**2 - (i-1))/2 < handshakes) && ((i**2 - i)/2 > handshakes)) {
